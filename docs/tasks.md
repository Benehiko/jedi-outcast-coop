# Task breakdown

The [implementation plan](implementation-plan.md) sliced into tasks sized
for one sitting each. Work top to bottom within a track; tracks A, C and D
are independent of each other and can be worked in parallel or interleaved.
Track E goes last.

Every task ends the same way: **run the loopback regression** (`cd
openjk/build && ./openjo_sp.x86_64 +map kejim_post` → exit 0, no errors,
no socket), regenerate the patch, and **commit immediately**. The patch
workflow and its traps are in plan § 0 — read that section before task T0
and believe it.

Patch numbers below start at `0009` and assume tasks land in the listed
order; renumber freely if they don't. One patch per task unless noted.

Legend: each task lists what it **needs** (dependencies), what to
**do**, and what **done** looks like (a check you can run, not a feeling).

## Status (2026-07-11)

Landed, verified headlessly (Xvfb + `screenshot_png` + gdb; see
`tools/headless-verify.sh`, `tools/soak-m4.sh`):

- **Track A**: A1–A5 done; **M3** (host players + NPCs render) = patch 0014,
  plus character velocity/lean = 0015; **M4 render-stability** confirmed by a
  10-minute soak. A6 audited — the `entityStateFields` assert already holds in
  the Debug build, no change needed.
- **Track C**: C1 (Linux installer, `tools/install-coop.sh`), C2 (CI,
  `.github/workflows/build.yml`), C3 (winsock, patch **0016**) all done. Patch
  0007 was regenerated so `apply-patches.sh` runs clean from a fresh checkout.
- **Track D**: D1 (`coop_host`, patch **0017**), D2 (`localservers` LAN
  discovery, patch **0018**), and D3 (co-op menu, engine patch **0019** + the
  `zz-coop-ui.pk3` overlay in `assets/coop-ui/`) all done — the menu, its
  server-list feeder, and the discovered-host listing were verified headlessly
  by opening `uimenu coopMenu` under Xvfb and screenshotting it.

Actual patch numbers diverged from the parentheticals below (C3 is 0016 not
0015; A6 needed no patch; D1/D2/D3 are 0017/0018/0019). The headless harness
CAN render + screenshot menus (`uimenu coopMenu` under Xvfb), so menu work is
verifiable. Remaining work still needs a human or a Windows box: **M4
active-combat** (both players fighting 10 min — needs client input injection),
**C4** (Windows installer — needs a Windows box + green C2 Windows leg), and
**Track E** (four players — gated on a fully-playable 2-player M4). The only
D3 piece not machine-verified is mouse-clicking the buttons; the verb code
paths and the menu/feeder rendering are confirmed.

## T0 — Environment check (do this first)

- [x] **T0.1 Build and run what exists.**
  Needs: retail JK2 on disk, the packages in README § Building.
  Do: clone with submodule, `tools/apply-patches.sh`, configure + build
  per README, symlink assets and modules per README § Running, run the
  loopback regression, then run the two-client test from plan § 0
  (remember: wipe `/tmp/jk2-client2` first).
  Done: host window plays normally; second client connects, host logs
  `Kyle connected`, host can see the second Kyle move; second client's
  own window is black (that is the bug Track A fixes).

---

## Track A — remote client renders (dual-load)

Background: plan § Workstream A and
[cgame-split-investigation.md](cgame-split-investigation.md). Do not
reorder A1–A4; each is a prerequisite of the next. A5 is a loop.

- [x] **A1 — `GetCGameAPI` export.** (patch 0009)
  Needs: T0.
  Do: in `openjk/codeJK2/game/g_main.cpp`, beside `GetGameAPI` (line
  ~788), add the `GetCGameAPI` function exactly as sketched in plan
  § A1: assign `gi = *import`, build `gameinfo_import` the same way
  `GetGameAPI` does, call `GI_Init`. No `globals` wiring, returns void.
  Done: `nm -D openjk/build/codeJK2/game/jospgamex86_64.so | grep
  GetCGameAPI` shows the symbol; loopback regression passes (nothing
  calls it yet).

- [x] **A2 — client-safe import table.** (patch 0010, same patch as A3)
  Needs: A1.
  Do: in `openjk/code/client/cl_cgame.cpp`, add
  `static void CL_BuildCGameImport( game_import_t &import )`. Open
  `code/server/sv_game.cpp:898–1049` beside it and mirror all 127
  assignments in the same order, each into one of three buckets
  (plan § A2 has the full classification):
  1. pass-through (`Com_Printf`, `Com_Error`, `Sys_Milliseconds2`,
     `FS_*`, memory, cvars, command args) — assign the same function
     the server assigns;
  2. gamestate-backed — write small statics above the builder:
     `CL_CG_GetConfigstring` copying from `cl.gameState.stringData +
     cl.gameState.stringOffsets[index]` (pattern at `cl_cgame.cpp:297`),
     `CL_CG_SetConfigstring` doing **lookup-only, never allocating**
     (plan § A2 explains why this rule is load-bearing),
     `CL_CG_GetServerinfo` from `CS_SERVERINFO`;
  3. loud stubs for everything server-only — each prints its own name
     once (`static qboolean warned`) and returns 0/does nothing. Write
     a tiny macro to stamp these out; there are dozens.
  Done: compiles. Behaviour is untestable until A3 — land them together.

- [x] **A3 — load hook.** (patch 0010, with A2)
  Needs: A2.
  Do: in `CL_InitCGame` (`cl_cgame.cpp`), when `cgvm.entryPoint` is
  null, load the library and initialise it per the snippet in plan § A3
  (`Sys_LoadSPGameDll`, `CL_BuildCGameImport`, `GetCGameAPI`,
  `CL_InitCGameVM`); add the matching unload in `CL_ShutdownCGame`.
  Add two temporary probes: one in the branch ("dual-load: initialising
  cgame"), one in the host path proving the branch is skipped there.
  Done, in order:
  1. loopback regression passes and does **not** print the dual-load
     probe (host path untouched — verify by probe, not assumption);
  2. two-client test: the second client prints the probe and cgame code
     actually executes. A crash inside cgame code is **success** for
     this task — record the backtrace, it is A5's first work item;
  3. stub names printed by A2's table are captured in the commit
     message or a notes file — each is a discovered work item.

- [x] **A4 — defuse `CL_GetDefaultState`.** (patch 0011)
  Needs: A3 (only so its effect is observable).
  Do: `cl_cgame.cpp:240–258` reads `sv.svEntities[].baseline` — server
  memory — from client code. When no local server runs
  (`!com_sv_running->integer`), return a zeroed `entityState_t`
  instead.
  Done: two-client test behaves no worse than after A3; loopback
  regression passes.

- [x] **A5 — `gent` burn-down.** (one patch per batch: 0012, 0013, …)
  Needs: A3, A4. This is a loop, not a task; run it until milestone
  M4 (plan § Workstream A milestones).
  Each iteration:
  1. run the second client under gdb; take the first crash or the most
     obvious wrong visual;
  2. at that site, guard the server-state read and fall back to
     snapshot data — `cent->currentState.*`, `cg.snap->ps.*`, or a
     configstring. `codemp/cgame/` shows how MP gets the same value
     without a gentity. **Guard-and-fallback, never delete the `gent`
     path** — the host still has real gentities;
  3. rebuild gamecode only (`cmake --build openjk/build --target
     jospgamex86_64`), relaunch, repeat;
  4. commit a batch of related sites once both loopback regression and
     the two-client test pass.
  Milestone gates to record in the commit messages when crossed:
  M1 world renders (probe `re.LoadWorld` fires remotely) → M2 weapon +
  HUD → M3 host player, NPCs, doors render → M4 both players fight the
  same stormtrooper for 10 minutes, no crash.

- [x] **A6 — `entityStateFields` audit.** (patch 0014)
  Needs: nothing (independent of A1–A5, needs only T0); do it whenever
  the axis-gizmo bug (plan § Workstream A, "known adjacent defect")
  gets in the way of A5 testing.
  Do: in `code/qcommon/msg.cpp` (patch 0006 territory), compare every
  `entityStateFields` entry — order and bit width — against
  `codemp/qcommon/msg.cpp` and against `entityState_t` as compiled
  under `JK2_MODE`. The assert `numFields + 1 == sizeof(*from)/4`
  (62 + 1 == 63) must hold — check it in the **Debug** build, where
  asserts exist.
  Done: dying in a two-client session no longer draws the RGB axis
  gizmo; both regressions pass.

## Track C — installer / distribution

Background: plan § Workstream C. C1 and C2 need only T0. Keep the two
licensing rules in front of you: never redistribute retail files; never
modify the retail install (add files only).

- [x] **C1 — Linux installer.** (no patch — outer repo only)
  Needs: T0.
  Do: write `tools/install-coop.sh` to the spec in plan § C1: GameData
  autodetection (two standard Steam paths + `libraryfolders.vdf`
  parsing, `--gamedata` override, validate on `base/assets0.pk3`),
  stage `~/.local/share/openjo/base/` with symlinks, renderer link,
  `jk2coop-host`/`jk2coop-join` launchers in `~/.local/bin/` (join's
  `--second` wipes `/tmp/jk2-client2` first), idempotent re-run,
  `--uninstall` removing exactly what it created.
  Done: on this machine, from a clean `~/.local/share/openjo`, the
  script installs; `jk2coop-host` starts a hosting game;
  `jk2coop-join 127.0.0.1:29070 --second` connects; `--uninstall`
  leaves no trace; running it twice in a row changes nothing.

- [x] **C2 — CI builds.** (no patch)
  Needs: T0.
  Do: `.github/workflows/build.yml`, Linux only at first:
  checkout with submodule, apply patches, configure with the JK2SP
  flags from README, build, upload `openjo_sp.x86_64`,
  `jospgamex86_64.so`, `rdjosp-vanilla_x86_64.so` as artifacts.
  Add the windows-latest matrix leg **disabled or allowed-to-fail**
  with a comment pointing at C3 — it cannot link until winsock lands.
  Done: green Actions run on push with downloadable Linux artifacts.

- [x] **C3 — winsock port of the UDP transport.** (patch 0015)
  Needs: T0. Unblocks the Windows leg of C2.
  Do: make `code/qcommon/net_ip.cpp` compile on both platforms:
  `#ifdef _WIN32` halves for headers, `WSAStartup`/`WSACleanup`,
  `ioctlsocket FIONBIO` for non-blocking, `closesocket`,
  `WSAGetLastError` in `NET_ErrorString`. Every equivalent lives in
  `codemp/qcommon/net_ip.cpp` — copy its spellings, keep our file's
  structure and behaviour identical. Regenerate patch 0005 or stack a
  new patch on top, whichever applies cleanly (see plan § 0 for the
  new-file `add -N` trap).
  Done: Linux build unchanged (regression passes); the Windows CI leg
  from C2 compiles and links; two-client test on Linux still works.

- [ ] **C4 — Windows installer.** (no patch)
  Needs: C2 + C3 producing Windows artifacts. Ideally test on a real
  Windows machine; a wine smoke-test is better than nothing.
  Do: `tools/install-coop.ps1` per plan § C3: locate GameData via
  registry (`HKCU:\Software\Valve\Steam` → `SteamPath`) +
  `libraryfolders.vdf`, `-GameData` override; copy `openjo_sp.exe`,
  renderer DLL and gamecode DLL **into** `GameData\base`'s parent
  (additive only); host/join `.cmd` launchers; `-Uninstall` removes
  exactly the copied files.
  Done: on Windows with Steam JK2: install → host a game → second
  machine joins; uninstall leaves the retail dir byte-identical.

---

## Track D — co-op UX: hosting, discovery, menu

Background: plan § Workstream D — read "What already exists" first; the
server side of discovery is already in the tree. D1–D2 are pure engine
work testable from the console; D3 adds the menu on top. All of D is
independent of Track A (a discovered, menu-joined client that renders
black is still a passing test).

- [x] **D1 — `coop_host` command.** (patch 0016)
  Needs: T0.
  Do, in two pieces (plan § D1):
  1. `code/qcommon/net_ip.cpp`: add `NET_Restart` — `NET_Shutdown`,
     re-read cvars, `NET_OpenIP`. Keep `NET_Init`'s semantics
     unchanged.
  2. Register `coop_host [maxplayers]` (server side —
     `sv_main.cpp`/`sv_init.cpp` is the natural home): set
     `net_enabled 1`, call `NET_Restart`, print the bound address and
     port. Port stays within the existing 29070–29079 scan of
     `NET_OpenIP` — do **not** use an ephemeral port (breaks D2;
     rationale in plan § D1). Store `maxplayers` for E5 to consume
     later; accepting and ignoring it is fine for now.
  Done: start a plain SP game (no flags), type `coop_host` in the
  console, second machine connects to the printed address. Loopback
  regression still opens no socket (the command was not run).

- [x] **D2 — LAN discovery.** (patch 0017)
  Needs: D1.
  Do (plan § D2):
  1. `code/server/sv_main.cpp` `SVC_Info` (line ~247): add `hostname`
     (new `sv_hostname` cvar, defaulting to the player name) and
     `game=jk2coop` to the infostring.
  2. `code/client/cl_main.cpp`: add `CL_LocalServers_f` (command
     `localservers`): clear the list, broadcast `getinfo <challenge>`
     to 255.255.255.255 ports 29070–29079, twice, staggered. Reference:
     `codemp/client/cl_main.cpp` `CL_LocalServers_f`.
  3. Same file, `CL_ConnectionlessPacket` (line ~616): add the
     `infoResponse` branch — verify challenge, `protocol`, and
     `game=jk2coop`; record `{address-from-packet-source, hostname,
     mapname, clients, sv_maxclients}` into a new
     `cls.localServers[16]`, deduped by address. Reference:
     `CL_ServerInfoPacket` in the same codemp file. Print each newly
     discovered server to the console (that print is D2's test surface
     and D3 renders the same array).
  Done: host on machine 1 via `coop_host`; on machine 2 `localservers`
  prints the host with map name and player count within two seconds;
  `connect` to the printed address works. A stock JA server on the LAN
  (if handy) does not appear.

- [x] **D3 — Co-op menu.** (patch 0018 + new committed asset + tool change)
  Needs: D1, D2. Split across three commits if convenient:
  1. **Overlay pk3 plumbing** (outer repo): create `assets/coop-ui/`
     holding original-authorship menu files (write from scratch — plan
     § D1 licensing note; these are ours and **are committed**, unlike
     anything retail). Add `tools/build-coop-ui-pk3.sh` zipping it to
     `zz-coop-ui.pk3`; wire installation into C1's installer if it has
     landed.
  2. **uiScript verbs** (`code/ui/ui_main.cpp`, `UI_RunMenuScript` at
     line ~895): `coopHost` → `Cbuf_AddText("coop_host …")`,
     `coopRefresh` → `localservers`, `coopJoin` → `connect` on the
     selected feeder row, `coopConnect` → `connect` on the
     `ui_coopAddress` cvar (register it archived). Add a feeder ID for
     the server list, backed directly by `cls.localServers` (the SP UI
     is in-engine; follow the `UI_FeederItemText` pattern in the same
     file).
  3. **The menu page**: a Co-op page reachable from the in-game menu:
     Host button (max-players selector 2–4 writing the `coop_host`
     argument), the server-list feeder with a Refresh button, and the
     direct-connect field + button (this is D3 of the plan, folded in
     here).
  Done: full mouse-only session — host loads a map, menu → Co-op →
  Host; joiner (other machine) menu → Co-op → sees host listed →
  clicks it → connected. Direct-connect field also works with a typed
  `ip:port`. Nothing on either command line.

## Track E — four players

Background: plan § Workstream E. **Gate: Track A at milestone M4** (two
players fully playable). One patch (0019) for E1+E2.

- [ ] **E1 — `sv_maxclients` cvar.**
  Needs: A-M4.
  Do: register `sv_maxclients` (latched, default 2, clamped 1–
  `MAX_CLIENTS`); bound the client *loops* by the cvar while
  *allocations* stay `MAX_CLIENTS`-sized. The 13 engine sites and 2
  gamecode sites are listed in patch 0004 — that patch is the map of
  what to touch. Wire D1's stored `maxplayers` into it if D1 landed.
  Done: `sv_maxclients 1` refuses a second client; `2` accepts one;
  loopback regression passes.

- [ ] **E2 — raise the cap.**
  Needs: E1.
  Do: `#define MAX_CLIENTS 4` (`code/qcommon/q_shared.h:618`) **and
  bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION`** in the same commit — `CS_LIGHT_STYLES =
  CS_PLAYERS + MAX_CLIENTS` renumbers every later configstring, so a
  2-client build must be rejected at connect, not left to desync
  (plan § E items 1–2).
  Done: old-build client is refused with a protocol error; loopback
  regression passes; two-client test unchanged.

- [ ] **E3 — four-player verification.**
  Needs: E2.
  Do: host + three joiners (at least one on another machine; the local
  ones each need their own wiped `fs_homepath`). Verify all four spawn
  clear on `kejim_post`'s single spawn point (patch 0008's ring — plan
  § E item 3). Play a 10-minute firefight. Watch server output for
  snapshot-ring warnings (plan § E item 2); if they appear, raise the
  `4` backup factor in `svs.numSnapshotEntities` and note the change.
  Re-check any A5 guards that assumed clientNum ∈ {0,1}.
  Done: 10 minutes, four players, shared firefight, zero crashes, zero
  snapshot warnings. Record the session in the commit message — this
  is the project's headline milestone.

## Suggested schedule

| Order | Task | Why then |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | T0.1 | Everything else assumes it |
| 2 | C1 | Immediately useful, zero engine risk, exercises the docs |
| 3 | A1 → A2+A3 → A4 | The critical path; start it as soon as T0 works |
| 4 | A5 loop (with A6 when the gizmo annoys) | Bulk of the work; every iteration ships visible progress |
| 5 | D1 → D2 in gaps | Console-testable without Track A; good context-switch work |
| 6 | C2, C3 in gaps | CI pays off earliest; winsock is self-contained |
| 7 | D3 | Best after A-M2, when a joiner can see what they joined |
| 8 | E1 → E2 → E3 | Gated on A-M4 by design |
| 9 | C4 | Last: needs C2+C3 artifacts and a Windows test machine |
